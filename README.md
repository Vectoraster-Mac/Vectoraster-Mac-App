## 💡 Overview  

**Vectoraster** is an advanced **halftone and vector texture creation tool** designed for digital artists and visual designers who seek both control and creativity in their work. It enables users to transform photos, gradients, or shapes into sophisticated halftone visuals and modular vector grids.  

This application blends artistic flexibility with algorithmic accuracy, making it ideal for generating complex geometric compositions, raster patterns, and optical effects. Each element can be adjusted in real time, with live previews showing how tone, scale, and distribution evolve with every tweak.  

Whether you’re designing posters, print graphics, or experimental digital art, **Vectoraster** delivers the precision and responsiveness needed to explore modern halftone aesthetics in a smooth, macOS-native workflow.
